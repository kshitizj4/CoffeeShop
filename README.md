To complete the task and make the website accessible online, you'll need to follow these steps:

Complete the Website Files:

Finish styling the website by adding CSS rules for different sections if needed.
Ensure all sections have appropriate content.
Optionally, add JavaScript for any additional functionality such as form validation or smooth scrolling.
Set Up Hosting:

Choose a web hosting provider. There are many options available, such as Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages for static sites.
Follow the hosting provider's instructions to set up an account and create a new website.
Upload Files:

Once you have your hosting set up, upload your website files (HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript) to your hosting provider's server. You can typically do this through an online dashboard or using FTP.
Accessing the Live Site:

After uploading the files, your website should be live and accessible through a URL provided by your hosting provider. It will typically be something like https://your-website-name.com.
Test the website by visiting this URL in a web browser to ensure everything is working correctly.
